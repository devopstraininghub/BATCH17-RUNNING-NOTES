ON-PREMISES : What is On-Premises?
============================

On-premises means:
You own and manage everything yourself (your own datacenter) 

This includes:
- Servers (big computers)
- Storage
- Networking equipment
- Power
- Cooling
- Security
- IT staff to maintain it


============================
CLOUD : What is Cloud?
============================

Cloud means:
Using someone else’s computers (servers) over the internet
instead of owning and managing your own.


============================
EXAMPLE: Running a Website
============================

ON-PREMISES:

- Buy a server
- Install OS and software
- Set up networking
- Handle power & cooling
- Fix hardware issues
- Upgrade when traffic grows
- Limited storage - External hard drive or  server
- Limited space
- If it breaks → data loss risk

Result:
- Takes time
- High cost
- Requires expertise


CLOUD:

- Create an account
- Click "Create Server"
- Choose server size
- Pay per hour or usage
- Scale up or down anytime AS PER REQUIREMENT 

Result:
- Fast
- Flexible
- Beginner-friendly


============================
KEY BENEFITS OF CLOUD
(Why Cloud is Popular)
============================

- No hardware to buy
- Pay only for what you use (Ondemand )
- Easy to scale resources
- High availability
- High Scalability
- Faster to start
- Global access from anywhere


============================
WHEN ON-PREMISES IS STILL USED
============================

Some companies prefer on-premises when:

- Strict data security laws exist
- Internet is not reliable
- Legacy systems are in use
- Full control over systems is required

LINUX BASICS FOR CLOUD

=====================================
1) WHY LINUX? WHY NOT WINDOWS?
=====================================

Simple Answer:
Cloud runs mostly on Linux, not Windows.


Why Linux?

- Free (open source) 
- Stable (Runs for years)
- Lightweight
- Secure & Reliable 
- Highly customizable
- Perfect for servers

Why not Windows?

- Windows is mainly designed for desktop users
- Heavier OS
- Paid license
- Less suitable for large-scale servers


=====================================
LINUX vs WINDOWS 
=====================================

Feature           Linux                     Windows
------------------------------------------------------------
Cost              Free (Open-source)        Paid license
Performance       Fast & lightweight        Heavy
Stability         Runs for years             Needs restarts
Security          Very secure               More virus-prone
Automation        Excellent (CLI-based)     Limited
Server usage      Very high                 Less
Cloud support     Default choice             Secondary


=====================================
UNIX (ORIGINAL)
=====================================

- Old operating system
- Created in the 1970s
- Expensive
- Mostly used in big enterprises
- Examples:
  - AIX
  - Solaris
  - HP-UX


=====================================
LINUX (INSPIRED BY UNIX)
=====================================

- Open-source
- Free
- Created in 1991
- Community-driven
- Runs everywhere:
  - Cloud
  - Mobile
  - Servers


=====================================
UNIX vs LINUX 
=====================================

UNIX                     Linux
------------------------------------------------
Proprietary              Open-source
Paid                     Free
Limited vendors          Huge community
Less flexible            Highly customizable
Legacy systems           Used everywhere today


=====================================
FEW IMPORTANT FACTS
=====================================

- Android is based on Linux
- AWS runs mostly on Linux
- Google runs on Linux
- Facebook runs on Linux
- Around 90% of internet servers run Linux
- Linux is the backbone of Cloud.

AWS FREE TIER 


AWS Free Tier allows new users to try AWS services
without paying immediately.

It is mainly used for:
- Learning AWS
- Practice
- Small experiments
- Beginners in Cloud


========================================
AWS FREE TIER – CURRENT USAGE MODEL
(NEW ACCOUNTS)
========================================

For new AWS accounts:

- AWS offers a Free Plan with credits
- You can get up to $200 AWS credits
  - $100 at signup
  - Up to $100 by completing learning activities

- Valid for:
  - 6 months
  - OR until credits are used (whichever comes first)

- No charges unless you upgrade to Paid Plan


========================================
IS IT FREE FOR 1 YEAR OR 6 MONTHS?
========================================

- Older AWS accounts (created earlier):
  - Had 12 months Free Tier for many services

- New AWS accounts:
  - Mostly follow 6-month Free Plan with credits

Note:
- AWS model may change over time
- Always check usage limits in AWS console


========================================
ALWAYS FREE SERVICES
(NO EXPIRY – WITH LIMITS)
========================================

Some services are free every month
within certain limits, even after credits end.

Examples:
- AWS Lambda
  - 1 million free requests per month
- Amazon S3
  - Limited free storage
- Amazon DynamoDB
  - Free storage and read/write capacity

(Usage limits apply)


========================================
IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER
========================================

- Credit card is required to create AWS account
- AWS follows pay-as-you-use model
- If you exceed free limits → you will be charged
- Always monitor billing dashboard


========================================
FINAL SUMMARY
========================================

AWS Free Tier is a starter pack for beginners.

- New users get free credits (valid ~6 months)
- Some services are always free within limits
- Best way to learn AWS hands-on
- Be careful with usage to avoid charges

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):
 
 
The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a set of guidelines that define the structure and organization of directories and files on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It aims to ensure consistency and compatibility between different distributions of Linux, making it easier for software developers, administrators, and users to navigate and understand the file system. Here are the key components of the FHS:

Root Directory (/)
/bin: Essential command binaries that are required for system operation (e.g., ls, cp, mv).

/boot: Files needed for the boot process, including boot loader configuration files and kernels.

/dev: Device files representing hardware devices attached to the system (e.g., /dev/sda for the first SATA drive).

/etc: Configuration files for the system and installed applications (e.g., /etc/passwd for user information).

/home: Home directories for regular users (e.g., /home/ec2-user).

/lib: Shared libraries needed by programs in /bin and /sbin.

/media: Mount points for removable media (e.g., USB drives).

/mnt: Mount points for temporary mounted filesystems.

/opt: Optional software packages that are not part of the operating system distribution.

/sbin: System binaries essential for system administration, typically used by the root user.

/srv: Data for services provided by the system (e.g., web server data).

/tmp: Temporary files that may be deleted between reboots.

/usr: Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of user utilities and applications.

/var: Variable data files, such as logs, spool files, and temporary files that persist between reboots.

---------------------

root --> /

ll

/bin – binary or executable programs.

 /sbin – binary executable programs for an administrator.

/etc – system configuration files.

/home – home directory. It is the default current directory.

/root - home directory of root user 

/opt – optional or third-party software.

/tmp – temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.

/usr – User related programs.

/var – log files.

df ( disk filesystem)  -
          It is used to report file system disk space usage, showing how much space is used and available on mounted file systems.


df -h 
df -m 

In Windows, drives such as C:, D:, and E: are logical designations assigned to storage devices or partitions. Each drive letter represents a separate filesystem namespace, allowing users and applications to access files and directories on that specific storage unit. 


In Linux, the concept of drive letters like C:, D:, and E: does not exist. Instead, Linux uses a single hierarchical directory structure that begins at the root directory (/). All storage devices, partitions, and network filesystems are integrated into this hierarchy by mounting them at specific directories


df 
df -h
df -m
